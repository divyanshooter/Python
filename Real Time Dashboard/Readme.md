# Bank Live Data Dashboard

This is a live data dashboard built using Streamlit, providing interactive visualization and analysis of banking data.

## Overview

This dashboard connects to a dataset containing banking information sourced from a CSV file. It allows users to filter the data based on job type and age range. The dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average age, married count, and account balance, along with visualizations including density heatmap and histograms.
